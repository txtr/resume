\def\ProjectStack{Docker, {\color{BrickRed}Java} ({\color{BrickRed}RPC}, {\color{BrickRed}Maven}, {\color{BrickRed}Kafka}, {\color{BrickRed}JUnit}, Threads)}

\def\ProjectBulletOne{Implemented distributed database system using Dockerised Springboot microservices and RAFT consensus protocol covering leader election, log replication, data consistency and fault tolerance features.}

\def\ProjectBulletTwo{Utilized Kafka message queues to facilitate communication and data exchange between microservices, providing reliable messaging and event-driven architecture for building scalable and resilient microservices.}

\def\ProjectBulletThree{Facilitated RPC on remote nodes and tested several resilience scenarios by simulating node shutdowns utilizing JUnit.}
